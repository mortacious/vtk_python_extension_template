# VTK Python Extension Template

This repo provides a template for building a VTK extension with python wrappers and link it against the libraries 
provided by the vtk python wheel. This allows distribution of the extension as a regular python-wheel as well.

This template it primarily an adapted version from https://github.com/Kitware/LookingGlassVTKModule to make it generic.
